# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview
#### In this project we have been provided with data from a ride share app called pyber. With this data we have been tasked to analyze and uncover trends. The scope of work includes using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlb to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. With this analysis we can discover trends and use the data to make reccomendations to further grow the app. 

## Results

#### The table below shows the final results obtained from the analysis.

#### From the data we can see that the Urban city type has the most rides but also has the lowest average fare per ride. Meanwhile the Rural area has the lowest rides but the highest average fare per ride. We can assume that this is because people who live in Rural areas have to travel longer distances to get to there destinations. Meanwhile a urban city is more compact and requires less travel to get to destinations. As well their is usually more people living in urban areas than in rural areas which can explain the higher ride count.

#### From the line graph above there seems to be no specific trend when it comes to the fare amount vs months. There just seems to be specific months that will do better maybe consider placing ads during the months of lower impact. 

## Summary
#### With this analysis there are three recommendations that I would suggest helping in order to help the business of each city type;

#### 1. The first is because there are more total drivers than total rides in the Urban city types, the Urban drivers may not have enough work to support themselves. PyBer may want to consider investing advertising dollars in the Urban city types to increase the total rides or possibly have to reduce their amount of Urban drivers.

#### 2. There should be Additional analysis of ride duration should be done. It may be insightful to calculate average fare per 1 minute or 1 kilometer and compare the value among city types. If the fare for 1 minute of ride in rural cities is significantly higher than fare in urban cities, ride fare may be increased for urban city types. It helps to increase average fare per ride in urban cities and get even more revenue.

#### 3. final reccomendation would be to implement some weekly or special event pricing deals. The final chart demonstrates that fare intake is pretty steady, even on holidays. With some ads and deals, Pyber might increase ridership on particular days.
